## os-development
- **under construction :3**
- just creating a tiny OS
- mainly to understand exploit development from the ground up  
- analyzing patterns in stable kernels wouldâ€™ve been better, but studying OS this semester so...  
- check resources.txt file for reference links
- finally back to the original goal :)
