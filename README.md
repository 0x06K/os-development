## os-development
- **under construction :3**
- just creating a tiny OS
- mainly to understand exploit development from the ground up  
- analyzing patterns in stable kernels wouldâ€™ve been better, but studying OS this semester so...  
- check resources.txt file for reference links
- finally back to the original goal [Fri Oct 24 06:33:49 PM PKT 2025] :)
- i noticed something i was creating big header files, including too many functions but that is wrong i have to make it minimal at first. it will make it easy for me to maintain the project as i am working alone on it, later on i can expand it though.
